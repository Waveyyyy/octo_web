octo_web is (will be) a web app for viewing the data from the [octopus energy api](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/#), made for me and my flatmates to see our energy things.

It's written in rust because I wanted to write it in rust.

any recommendations/tips are welcome

## TODO

1. Get requests working nicely
1. Implement reading from a .env/config file 
   - for sensitive stuffs like the API key
1. Experiment with API and find the useful endpoints
   - Figure out how best to access these
   - think up a cool intuitive way to do refreshes
1. Begin researching and building the web stuffs
   - how does rust do http servers ?!
